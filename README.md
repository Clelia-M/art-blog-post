# ðŸŽ¨ Art History Blogpost Page
## Description

Landing page for an Art Blog post on Art Principles and history created with Bootstrap and customised CSS.

It is built in HTML and CSS using the Bootstrap framework. 

I loved it because it is my first personal project with no tutorial and it helped me use and better understand Bootstrap.
